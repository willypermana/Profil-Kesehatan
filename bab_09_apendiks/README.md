# On Appendix 3 - Profile Tables
There's really no short way to make this particular appendix in LaTeX. `excel2latex` add-in helps, but you'd still need to fine tune every single tables.

Conversely you can just use the Excel provided sheet from Pusdatin and call it a day, but then you have to find another way to integrate them to the List of Tables...

Not going to put all of tables here. Just the very first one and a quite long table for the general idea.
